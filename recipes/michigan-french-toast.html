    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious Michigan french toast from "Ramsey around the world"</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>About ¼ cup heavy cream, divided</li>
        <li>2 small red apples, cores removed and chopped into large pieces</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cognac</li>
        <li>3 thick slices white sandwich bread</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Thimbleberry jam</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons crème fraîche</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by placing two large nonstick skillets over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk, then continue whisking while adding about 1 ½ tablespoons sugar, followed by heavy cream. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining sugar to one skillet and let sit for a moment so it begins to caramelize. Add the apples to the pan along with about a tablespoon of butter, tossing to coat.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the apple cognac over the apples, followed by another tablespoon or so of heavy cream.</li>
        <li>ring the mixture to a low boil.</li>
        <li>Quickly dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture to coat, but don't let it soak. </li>
        <li>Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the other skillet along with about a tablespoon of butter. Once melted, add the coated slices to the hot pan and let brown. Add a few teaspoons of butter around the edges of the pan. Carefully flip each bread slice (only flip once!) to lightly brown the other side, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Once the apples have absorbed the cream and are jammy and almost candied, remove from heat.</li>
        <li>To serve, spread a couple of tablespoons of thimbleberry jam onto one slice of bread on a plate, then top with a few tablespoons of the caramel apples.</li>
        <li>Place another slice of bread on top of the apples and repeat. Place the third slice of bread on top, then top with a dollop with crème fraîche, followed by a small bit of thimbleberry jam. Scatter any remaining apples around the plate and serve.</li>
    </ol>
