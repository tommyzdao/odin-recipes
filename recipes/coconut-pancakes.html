      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This makes the most brilliant breakfast or brunch, and rings the changes if you 
         are in a rut of making the same old plain crepes with lemon or maple syrup. It's 
	 important to leave the batter to relax for 15 minutes as it will thicken slightly, making for 
	 fuller, fluffy panckes.<p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     
     <ul>
     <li>100g unsweetened desiccated coconut</li>
     <li>100g plain flour</li>
     <li>1 1/2 tsb baking powder</li>
     <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
     <li>250mL coconut milk (shake tin before measuring to distribute the solids evenly)</li>
     <li>1 tbsp runny honey</li>
     <li>Oil, for frying</li>
     <li>1 ripe mango</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Ingredients for the lime syrup</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>150g caster sugar</li>
      <li>Juice of 4 limes, finely grated zest of 1</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Method</h2>
     <ol>
      <li>To make the pancake batter, put the coconut the coconut into a blender and blitz for 1 minute or until it becomes finely chopped. Add the flour and the baking powder and pulse for a couple of seconds to combine. Pour into a mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Make a well in the flour and add the egg. Stir into the flour, then add the coconut milk and honey, mixing until a smooth batter forms. Cover and leave to rest for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, make the lime syrup. Put the sugar, 150mL of water, the lime juice and zest into a small saucepan or frying pan. Bring to a gentle simmmer and stir until has dissolved. Continue to simmer for 10 minutes until the liquid has reduced slightly and developed a syrupy consistency. Taste and add a little more lime zest if necessary. Leave to cool until just warm</li>
      <li>To cook the pancakes, heat a little oil in a large non-stick frying pan, swirling it around to cover the bottom. Place heaped tablespoons of batter in the pan (You will probably have to do this in batches) and cook over a medium-low heat for 2-3 minutes until golden. Turn over with a palette knife and repeat on the other side until golden and cooked through. Remove and set aside in a warm place while you cook the remaining batter.</li>
      <li>Peel the mango and cut the flesh into thin slices. Serve the pancakes and slices of mango and a drizzle of lime syrup on top.</li>
